House Price Prediction:

Objective: Built a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other property attributes.

Key Techniques:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and data distributions.
- Applied feature engineering techniques, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Implemented multiple machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines, and fine-tuned them using hyperparameter optimization.
- Used cross-validation for model evaluation and assessed performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.

Outcome: Achieved an improved model with and gained valuable insights into the relationship between different features and house pricing.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git.
